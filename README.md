# InstaUnfollower 🚀

A free and simple Chrome Extension that automatically unfollows everyone you follow on Instagram — no API keys, no login, no third-party services. Works right in your browser.

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Automatically clicks "Following" and confirms "Unfollow"
- 🔁 Scrolls through your full Following list
- ⏳ Runs safely with delay between actions (avoids Instagram ban)

## 🧠 How It Works

Instagram loads following users dynamically. This extension:
1. Opens the "Following" popup
2. Unfollows all visible users
3. Scrolls down
4. Repeats until all are unfollowed
